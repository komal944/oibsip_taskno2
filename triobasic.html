                    <hr class="hr-style">
                    <p>Sindhutai Sapkal, affectionately known as the "Mother of Orphans", is an Indian social worker and social activist known particularly for her work in raising orphaned children in India. She was conferred a Doctorate in Literature by the DY Patil Institute of Technology and Research in 2016.<br>
                        Sindhutai was born on 14th November 1948 in a cattle grazing family in Maharashtra's Wardha district. Being an unwanted child, she was referred to as Chindhi (Marathi for "torn piece of cloth"). However, her father was keen on educating Sindhutai, much against the wishes of her mother. Abhimanji (Sindhutai's father) used to send her to school under the pretext of cattle grazing, where she would use the 'leaf of Bharadi Tree' as a slate as she could not afford a real slate due to her family's limited financial resources. Abject poverty, family responsibilities and an early marriage forced her to quit formal education after she successfully passed the 4th standard.

                        <h2>Turning Point Of Sindhutai Sapkal</h2>
                        <hr class="hr-style">
                        <p>-An early marriage forced her to quit formal education after she passed through the fourth grade.<br>- At the tender age of 12, she got married to Shrihari Sapkal alias Harbaji.<br>- Sindhutai complained to the village chief's district officer that She did not charge the villagers. To avenge their insult, Mukhiyana Srihari (Sindhutai's husband) was instigated by the villagers to kick Sindhutai out of the house while she was 9 months pregnant<br>- Her husband thrashed her and kicked her on her belly when she was in her final trimester and threw her in a cowshed.<br>- She gave birth to a baby girl and cut her umbilical cord with the stone by hitting it 16 times.<br>- Later, she went to her maternal village but was shunned and her mother too closed the doors on her (her father died, otherwise he would have kept her daughter). <br>- Sindhutai was staying with her daughter at the train station. Praying to fill her stomach and stay in the cremation at night to protect herself and her daughter.<br>- For survival Sindhutai slept at the crematorium . To end her hunger , she relied on flour left as a part of last rituals for the departed soul and would prepare bhakari(roti) on the fire erupting from the pyre of a dead body.<br>- Recounting the hardships she faced in her life, in a talk show , Sindhutai Sapkal had once said that she did not want to become a mother to an orphan as she had nothing and she would beg at the station at the age of 20 , carrying a child. She would sing as people would give food only then .<br>- She wanted to die and made three unsuceesful attempts to end her life before she decided to live for others <br>- She entrusted her little daughter whom she had named Mamta to Shrimant Dagadusheth Halwai Trust.<br>- In her fight, She realized that there are so many orphans in the country who need a mother. From that moment She decided that any orphan who came to her would become her child.<br>- Her orphange keeps a ward till the age of 18 , but she keeps them till they settle in life  </p>
